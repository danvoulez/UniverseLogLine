# 🌅 Morning Deploy - LogLine Universe

**Timestamp**: 2025-10-04T08:10:00Z  
**Status**: Triggering fresh deployment after Rust fix  
**Previous Issue**: Rust 1.75 → 1.82 upgrade completed  

## Current Situation:
- ✅ **Redis**: Working perfectly
- ❌ **PostgreSQL**: Needs restart
- ❌ **LogLine Services**: Failed builds (old Rust version)

## Solution:
This commit will trigger fresh builds with Rust 1.82, which should resolve all compilation issues.

## Expected Result:
All 6 LogLine services should build successfully and deploy.

🚀 **Fresh morning deployment initiated!**
