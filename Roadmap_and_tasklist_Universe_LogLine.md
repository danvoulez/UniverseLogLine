# Universe LogLine Roadmap & Task List

## Roadmap

### Recommended Architecture Approach
- Establish a modular architecture composed of dedicated crates and services (e.g., `logline-core`, `logline-id`, `logline-protocol`, `logline-timeline`, `logline-rules`, `logline-engine`, `logline-api`, `logline-federation`, and `logline-onboarding`).
- Use the shared `logline-core` crate for foundational types, configuration, logging, database abstractions, and communication primitives.
- Layer services so that identity and protocol underpin the timeline, rules, engine, and user-facing APIs.
- Keep each service cohesive while ensuring they can evolve independently.

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### 1. Shared Foundation (`logline-core`)
- Publish common data structures, error types, serialization utilities, configuration handling, database abstractions, WebSocket primitives, and logging infrastructure in a reusable crate consumed by all other services.

#### 2. Identity System (`logline-id`)
- Provide identity generation and management, key pair handling, signature creation/verification, storage, authentication mechanisms, and multi-tenant support with both programmatic and HTTP/WebSocket interfaces.

#### 3. Protocol Layer (`logline-protocol`)
- Standardize communication through message formats, serialization standards, schema definitions, command structures, event types, and state transfer protocols.

#### 4. Timeline Service (`logline-timeline`)
- Deliver storage (PostgreSQL/NDJSON), span creation/management, querying/filtering, replay, multi-tenant isolation, bundle handling, and synchronization primitives.

#### 5. Rules Engine (`logline-rules`)
- Provide grammar parsing, rule execution environment, and expand to context management, rule storage/versioning, rule chaining, and tenant isolation.
  - [x] Grammar parsing and validation (YAML/JSON loader with structural checks)
  - [x] Rule execution environment
  - [ ] Context management
  - [ ] Rule storage and versioning
  - [ ] Rule chaining and dependencies
  - [ ] Multi-tenant rule isolation

#### 6. Core Engine (`logline-engine`)
- Implement the execution runtime, scheduler, state management, rule orchestration, timeline integration, and event dispatch.

#### 7. API Layer (`logline-api`)
- Supply REST endpoints, optional GraphQL, authentication/authorization, OpenAPI documentation, SDK generation, WebSocket support, and rate limiting/security features.

#### 8. Federation (`logline-federation`)
- Manage node discovery, trust relationships, timeline synchronization, conflict resolution, consensus, and distributed coordination.

#### 9. Onboarding (`logline-onboarding`)
- Provide user registration, tenant creation, user management, permissions, identity provisioning, and configuration wizards.

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Shared Database Services**
   - PostgreSQL instances (potentially separate for timeline vs. other data).
   - Redis for caching and pub/sub (e.g., WebSocket coordination).
2. **Core Services (Always Running)**
   - `logline-id`, `logline-timeline`, `logline-engine`, `logline-api`.
3. **Supporting Services (Scale Independently)**
   - `logline-federation`, `logline-rules`, `logline-onboarding`.

### Development Process
1. **Start with Core Libraries** – build `logline-core` and `logline-protocol`, establish testing and CI/CD.
2. **Identity and Timeline Foundation** – implement `logline-id` and `logline-timeline` with strong data integrity.
3. **Engine and Rules** – develop `logline-engine` and `logline-rules`, ensuring rule execution works correctly.
4. **API and Client Interface** – create `logline-api` and initial client libraries.
5. **Federation and Onboarding** – add `logline-federation` and `logline-onboarding` for multi-node support and user management.

### Communication Architecture
- **REST API** for client-to-API communication, administrative operations, and CRUD.
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates, event notifications, and long-running operations.
- **gRPC** for high-performance service-to-service communication with schema enforcement.

### Data Flow Considerations
- **Command Flow**: Client → API → Engine → Rules/Timeline → Database with event propagation.
- **Query Flow**: Client → API → Timeline/Engine → Database with synchronous responses.
- **Federation Flow**: Node A Federation → Node B Federation → Node B Services with bidirectional sync.

### Implementation Order and Dependencies
1. Build foundational components (`logline-core`, shared database infrastructure).
2. Implement identity system (`logline-protocol`, `logline-id`).
3. Add core data management (`logline-timeline`, CI/CD pipelines).
4. Implement processing components (`logline-rules`, `logline-engine`, inter-service communication).
5. Add client-facing services (`logline-api`, `logline-federation`, `logline-onboarding`).
6. Finalize integration, documentation, and observability (client SDKs, documentation, monitoring).
