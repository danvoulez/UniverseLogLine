FORCE REBUILD - Railway Cache Bust
Timestamp: 2025-10-04T08:22:30Z

Railway is still using cached Rust 1.75 builds.
This file forces a complete rebuild with Rust 1.83.

Changes made:
- Updated Dockerfile to Rust 1.83
- Added .dockerignore
- Created this cache-busting file

Railway MUST detect this and rebuild from scratch!
